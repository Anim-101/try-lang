## 🎯 Learning Objectives

In this demo, you'll learn:
- Create custom tools for agents
- Build agents that use tools
- Understand agent reasoning
- Build autonomous AI systems

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Demos 1-5
- Understanding of chains and retrieval

## 🔑 Concepts Covered

### 1. Tools
Functions that agents can use to accomplish tasks.

### 2. Agent Types
Different agent architectures (ReAct, Zero-shot, etc.).

### 3. Tool Calling
How agents decide which tools to use and when.

### 4. Multi-Step Reasoning
Agents breaking down complex tasks.

## 🚀 Running the Demo

```bash
cd demos/06_agents
python example.py
```

## 📝 What You'll Build

Examples of:
1. Creating custom tools
2. Building agents with tool access
3. Multi-step problem solving
4. Practical agent applications

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Agents can autonomously use tools
- Tools extend agent capabilities
- Agents use reasoning to solve problems
- ReAct pattern combines reasoning and action
