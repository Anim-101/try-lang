# Demo 3: Chains and Sequential Operations

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

In this demo, you'll learn:
- Create simple LLM chains
- Build sequential workflows
- Chain multiple operations together
- Use LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Demo 1 and Demo 2
- Understanding of prompts and templates

## 🔑 Concepts Covered

### 1. LLMChain
Basic chain combining a prompt template and an LLM.

### 2. Sequential Chains
Chain multiple operations in sequence.

### 3. LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)
Modern way to build chains using the `|` operator.

### 4. Custom Chains
Build your own chain logic for specific use cases.

## 🚀 Running the Demo

```bash
cd demos/03_chains
python example.py
```

## 📝 What You'll Build

Examples of:
1. Basic LLMChain
2. Sequential multi-step chains
3. LCEL syntax for clean chain building
4. Practical chain applications

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Chains connect components together
- LCEL provides clean, composable syntax
- Chains can be simple or complex
- Sequential processing enables powerful workflows
