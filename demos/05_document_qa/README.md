# Demo 5: Document Q&A with Embeddings

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

In this demo, you'll learn:
- Load and process documents
- Create vector embeddings
- Build a Q&A system over documents
- Use vector stores for retrieval

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Completed Demos 1-4
- Understanding of chains and memory

## 🔑 Concepts Covered

### 1. Document Loaders
Load documents from various sources (PDF, text, web, etc.).

### 2. Text Splitters
Break documents into chunks for processing.

### 3. Embeddings
Convert text to vector representations.

### 4. Vector Stores
Store and search embeddings efficiently.

### 5. Retrieval Q&A
Answer questions based on document content.

## 🚀 Running the Demo

```bash
cd demos/05_document_qa
python example.py
```

## 📝 What You'll Build

Examples of:
1. Loading and splitting documents
2. Creating embeddings
3. Storing in vector database
4. Querying documents with natural language
5. Building a complete Q&A system

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Documents must be chunked for effective retrieval
- Embeddings enable semantic search
- Vector stores make retrieval fast
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) improves accuracy
