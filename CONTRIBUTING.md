# Contributing to LangChain Demo Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this LangChain learning repository!

## How to Contribute

### Adding New Demos

1. **Choose a Topic**: Select a LangChain concept not yet covered
2. **Create Directory**: Follow the naming convention `demos/XX-topic-name/`
3. **Write Demo Code**: Create well-commented, runnable examples
4. **Add Documentation**: Include a comprehensive README.md
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure the demo works as expected
6. **Update Main README**: Add your demo to the learning path

### Demo Structure

Each demo should include:
```
demos/XX-topic-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # Explanation and key concepts
â””â”€â”€ demo_script.py      # Runnable code with comments
```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Include type hints where helpful
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep code simple and readable
- Comment complex sections

### Documentation Style

Each README.md should include:
- **Overview**: Brief description
- **What You'll Learn**: Key takeaways
- **Running the Demo**: How to execute
- **Key Concepts**: Important terms explained

### Example Demo Template
